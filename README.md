## üîë Environment Variables

**This repository was primarily created for testing and developing the NPP plugin on local.** However, with minor adjustments, It can also be used as a **production** environment.

Please check the **.env** file for the environment variables used in the project. Some variables can be directly modified by the user for easy customization, while others are derived from the **original Dockerfiles of core services**. Changing these **core variables** for a production environment may require adjustments in other parts of the project to maintain seamless integration and workflow. Feel free to customize it to suit your full-stack WordPress **production** needs!

### Use the Bleeding-Edge Version of NPP (Default)

If you want to use the latest **bleeding-edge version** of the NPP plugin simply set the following environment variable:  

```bash
NPP_EDGE=1
```

üîÑ This will sync the plugin with the latest development branch commit from GitHub, ensuring you always have access to the newest features and improvements.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è In Production

To enable **Nginx Cache Preload** in a **localhost** development environment, a small host configuration adjustment is **always** required. In **production**, this may or may not be required depending on your Docker architecture. If you encounter a **Cache Preload** issue in production, try enabling the below setting in **.env**, otherwise, you can disable it entirely.

```bash
NPP_HACK_HOST=1
```
